# Connect Four - Multimedia Project

This project was a great opportunity to refresh my knowledge of JavaScript DOM management and to clarify and improve my understanding of CSS and how to interact with different elements. I also enjoyed maintaining a clean and uniform style across all the pages. I aimed to implement a consistent, simple, and visually appealing design for the project.
